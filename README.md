## Introduction

Welcome to our HR Insights Dashboard with Candidates Recommendation project! This project aims to provide valuable insights into HR data and recommend suitable candidates for various positions within an organization. Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models and visualization tools, we strive to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the recruitment process.

## Overview

In today's competitive job market, organizations face the challenge of identifying and hiring the best talent swiftly. Traditional methods of recruitment often fall short in providing actionable insights and personalized recommendations. Our project addresses this issue by employing cutting-edge technologies, including H2O.ai's machine learning platform and Wave H2O for intuitive dashboard visualization.

## Key Features

- **HR Data Integration**: Our system seamlessly integrates HR data from various sources, including applicant tracking systems, resumes, performance reviews, and employee databases.

- **Machine Learning Models**: We utilize H2O.ai's powerful machine learning algorithms, such as H2O's AutoML, to analyze and extract meaningful patterns from the HR data. These models are trained to predict candidate suitability for specific roles based on historical data and relevant features.

- **Candidate Recommendation**: Leveraging the insights generated by our machine learning models, the dashboard provides personalized recommendations for candidates best suited for particular job positions. These recommendations consider factors like skills, experience, education, and cultural fit.

- **Visualization Dashboard**: Wave H2O's intuitive dashboard allows users to visualize key HR metrics, candidate profiles, and recommendation results in an interactive and customizable manner. This enables HR professionals and hiring managers to make informed decisions quickly.
